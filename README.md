# About
This is an [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) application made with the [nativefier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier) comandline tool. This application is mearly a lightweight browser set to connect to the google android messages webpage, meaning it is by no means an official client and I have not done anything with the code of the android messages service.

# features
